transcript: '<p>STEPHEN CARPENTER: What I wanted to demonstrate is how this press
  works. I want to show how to make a proper water filter. And this is a ceramic water
  filter that I''m going to create here. And that''s essentially a focus of the first
  talk. This is bisque-fired filters made with clay and sawdust. Dry clay, dry sawdust,
  about 50/50. And when the sawdust burns out, it leaves pores.</p><p>Now, the clay
  is naturally porous, but the sawdust allows for more porosity, and so the water
  can flow through. If you have water that''s contaminated with microbes and pathogens
  that might create things like cholera, E. coli, Giardia, you can put that water
  into this filter. It will filter about one to three liters an hour. And that water
  is rendered about 95% free of those contaminants.</p><p>If we add a small amount
  of colloidal silver to the filter by brushing it on-- usually, it''s a less than
  a gram with about 500 milliliters of water. That silver acts as a natural antimicrobial
  and will render inert approximately the remaining 4 and 1/2% to 5% of the bad stuff
  that''s in that water. So this is one of those approaches that allows us to have
  potable water or adequate access to clean water.</p><p>A few years ago, I was working
  with some undergrad engineering students. I said, look, I have this dilemma. Here''s
  the situation. We have this big press that''s used conventionally to make these
  filters, but it''s really tough to take with me on the road. Can you make one that
  fits in a suitcase? They said, yeah. Can you make one that makes the same size filters?
  Yeah. Can you make one that doesn''t cost any money or costs as little as possible?
  They said, well, maybe.</p><p>And they did it. This is the filter press. It was
  collapsed earlier. I assembled this. And they made this out of repurposed materials,
  but also, some of the material I gave them, which was this bell, the male and female
  molds here. So I''ll demonstrate how this works to make a filter. Usually, again,
  the filters are made on a full-sized press, but this is a smaller press.</p><p>This
  is both the prototype and the final product and the only one in existence. Cool
  thing about this is one person can operate it. Usually with those big presses, it''s
  easier if two people operate it. But one person can do very well. So this is a male
  mold. This is essentially very lightweight steel. So we have this bell form. And
  what we''re going to do is put the clay in the middle, and we''ll make the filter
  this way.</p><p>So this is the metal mold, the bottom of the mold. I''m going to--
  thank you-- put this plastic down as a release agent. Because the clay will stick
  to the metal. It doesn''t like to stick to the plastic. And I have this bat. It
  has a bevel in it, approximately the same angle as the bell. Then, I''m going to
  put this clay--</p><p>So I''m going to put the second piece of plastic on, and then
  I''ll put this top part. What''s interesting is that the original traditional approach
  to these larger presses used concrete molds, and then they moved to lighter weight
  metal molds. And so this is the same exact mold that one would find on a larger
  press. Now, this is the part that sometimes gets tricky, because you''ve got to
  make sure both of these sides are latched down.</p><p>Take this arm and tighten
  up the jack. And then, with just a simple-- this is a fun part. I like to say you
  have to get up to get down. You have to push this thing up in order for it to have
  resistance and push back down. At this point, I am going to release the pressure.
  All right, we''ll tighten this back up.</p><p>Certainly, this machine, this press,
  portable press, wouldn''t necessarily work well for a proper production facility
  where you want to crank out lots of filters in a day or in a week. But certainly,
  to establish a facility in a community that needs clean water using this technology,
  we can use this press to create filters very quickly and give ourselves a baseline
  of not only the clay but how the filtration works. Lift this back up. Take the bell
  off. And there''s our filter.</p><p>Just takes a little bit of cleanup at this point.
  Again, I''m using my thumb just to pull some of this extra off, but I could certainly
  use-- and this is what you would do in a production facility, would be to take a
  clay tool and to clean this up, as well. And then, because this bat is wider than
  the base, I simply lift, and there''s the filter. I can lay this-- place this down
  on a shelf in the studio or in the facility.</p><p>Another worker would clean it
  up, smooth up some of the edges, perhaps. Stamp it with a date and a number so we
  can track the way that it operates. We let it dry, then we fire it. We put it in
  the kiln. We fire it to about 866 degrees C. And what happens then is the sawdust
  burns out, which then creates a more porous vessel that allows the water to flow
  at a more rapid pace than it would if it wasn''t as porous.</p><p>This is ready
  to make another filter. I could put plastic down, another bat down. We could continue
  to make filters as long as we had clay. So with one person, that was, what, about
  a 10-minute time frame. With two people, you could move much more quickly. But the
  reason I wanted to demonstrate this to you is to show you, in real time, what it
  takes to create a water filter.</p><p>What if you designed houses, what if you designed
  shelters, what if you designed access to water as if you really cared about people
  getting it? Not that you cared about making money from it, or that you were interested
  in fame, or that you were just doing it to do it. What if you gave a damn about
  the situation? What if you cared in more direct ways? What would that look like?</p><p>In
  ways that would be affordable to people who need it, but also appropriate in terms
  of appropriate technology. The idea that materials and practices and processes that
  allow for things like shelter and food and water access to happen do not complicate
  a cultural set of rules and practices. It''s appropriate for the culture. It''s
  appropriate for the situation. Thinking about culture as the way we do things around
  here. So does the technology interrupt the way we do things around here? Does it
  pose confusion?</p><p>So this is the gentleman who invented, or is credited with
  coming up with, the approach, Dr. Fernando Mazariegos, who was from Guatemala. And
  as a first response to natural disasters, Mazariegos thought if we had this porous
  vessel that allowed for water to flow through, that contaminated water to flow through
  at a fairly rapid pace, we might be able to produce adequate access to clean water,
  to potable water, after natural disasters.</p><p>And so Mazariegos then was contacted
  by Ron Rivera. Ron was working with Potters For Peace at the time. This was in the
  late ''80s, early ''90s. And Ron learned the process and started setting up a water
  filter production facility through Potters For Peace. Met Ron Rivera a number of
  years ago at a conference. And several months after I met him, he passed away. He
  was working in Nigeria to help a community set up a water filter production facility
  so that they wouldn''t contract malaria and would not die from malaria.</p><p>Ron
  came back from that trip and died from a very rare and difficult strain of malaria.
  So he gave his life so that others could have clean water. And whenever I give a
  presentation, I always think of that very special moment meeting Ron. But the idea
  is that it''s possible for this technology to be passed along to folks so that they
  can use it to move throughout the world and through communities to help other people.</p><p>This
  is a cross-section. This is a drawing that Manny did of the filter inside the receptacle.
  You see the addition of a spigot and a lid. And these are two important components.
  You need a spigot to get the water out and a lid to keep hands and other things
  entering into the filter. Contamination is a big issue, right?</p><p>These filters,
  as you see here, if they were sitting on a counter in a kitchen, you can put anything
  in. Your hands can touch them. External things could touch them. And you can contaminate
  the water. Even the water that is flowing through can get contaminated. So a lid
  is necessary.</p><p>I don''t know if you can hear, but this one is dripping quite
  loudly now that the water is flowing. We have some dirty water that we were using
  earlier. And we filled these filters up. I''m going to lift this one up so you can
  see it. You can''t see the cross-section. This is the cross-section. Here''s the
  spigot. I don''t have the lid, but I''ll lift this up. You''ll notice the bell shape,
  and you should see the water dripping from the filter.</p><p>You see that? And if
  you come up later, after we give this little chat, you''ll be able to see the clean
  water that''s in there. So this is a point-of-use water filter. It''s placed in
  the point in which it will be used in the home, usually in a kitchen. And the idea
  is that you would fill it up in the morning-- in the evening, I''m sorry, before
  you go to sleep. It will filter through the night, and in the morning, you have
  water for cooking and drinking. You fill it up again sometime during the day, and
  then you have another batch of water in the evening.</p><p>So, again, point-of-use
  water filters. These filters, again, the technology is the same. The idea is the
  same, but because clay and needs are different in different locations, various organizations
  have set up facilities under different names, but using the same technology, the
  same idea. Because the need for clean water is a global need. The right to access
  to water is a basic human right.</p><p>So this little girl and the other two children
  in the image are drinking water like they do every day. I can go right to that water
  fountain down the hallway and get a drink of water, or my water bottle is here somewhere.
  I can drink out of that. Many of you have water bottles. This is the same water
  that you see in the background. This water is the same water where the cows have
  defecated, where people have thrown away whatever it is they''re throwing away in
  that water. This little girl is in Honduras.</p><p>This gentleman is getting water
  for his family, his well. And that box has a little opening on the face, on the
  plane facing us. He reaches his hand in, puts a few coins in there, and the water
  comes out of that long tube. Water''s been sitting in some sort of receptacle reservoir
  underneath. He fills up the containers in the back of his truck and then drives
  those containers home. Then has to figure out how to get the water into his house.
  Then has to figure out how to make sure the water is clean and safe to drink. This
  gentleman is in South Texas, outside of Laredo.</p><p>Half a million people do not
  have utilities, paved roads, and housing that''s up to code in South Texas, from
  El Paso to Brownsville and 150 miles north, that green swath that you see in that
  map. That''s South Texas. Half a million people. They don''t have adequate access
  to clean water, either. And so my colleague at Texas A&amp;M, Oscar Munoz, is the
  director of the Colonias program and works with communities along that region.</p><p>Social
  practice and public pedagogy, linking those two, this notion of intentionally disruptive
  responsibility. Social practice being a term that grows out of a number of moves
  in contemporary art, where it has been theorized by people like Clara Bishop and
  Pablo Helguera and others to think about the way in which artists or artistic practices
  intersect with social issues and conventions from other disciplines to make positive
  change or to enact change through intentional modes.</p><p>Public pedagogy, very
  much like what we did this morning. We were out, essentially, on the sidewalk--
  or we were on the patio that overlooked the sidewalk-- mixing clay and sawdust in
  preparation for making water filters. And people stopped and said, what are you
  doing? Right there, you have developed a relationship, this interchange, by asking
  a question and responding and this back and forth and back and forth. There''s some
  learning that goes on in both directions. And talking to folks about the water filters
  through a public forum in a public space is one form that we might consider public
  pedagogy.</p><p>When I moved it to Penn State, I decide to put a name to these performances--
  collaborative creative resistance. I mean, Larry and I were talking about titles.
  And sometimes, the title''s enough to tease and pull folks in. But the idea of how
  might we collaboratively work together to resist those hegemonic forces or to disrupt
  what others might find acceptable.</p><p>So with a small grant from the Institute
  for the Arts and Humanities, I did a performance in front of the Palmer Museum of
  Art. So there''s a proximity to the art museum. So maybe it''s more art-like because
  it''s closer to the museum? I''m not necessarily saying that. But it was a wonderful
  open space that allowed for the middle of campus to stumble upon it. That was a
  Friday afternoon in the middle of April. Set up the press. Started making filters.
  People stopped by.</p><p>Students in art education and in the School of Visual Arts
  volunteered to sieve sawdust and to mix the clay. Although I knew this would probably
  happen, I didn''t count on it happening to the degree that it did. In the background
  of this image, and in the very foreground, you probably see people who are a little
  younger than what you might expect to see on college campuses. These are children
  who came from the local daycare center on campus and from the local elementary schools.</p><p>The
  daycare folks knew I was going to do it, because I had talked to them. But the kids
  from the elementary schools, their teachers and the kids thought they were going
  inside the museum to see art. But when they got off the bus, they saw this guy with
  a fedora wedging clay and using this big guillotine-looking machine in the middle
  of campus. They''d rather stay outside and talk to that guy. We had wonderful conversations
  about adequate access to clean water.</p><p>Former student Sam Bachmann, who''s
  a ceramic artist, dual degree studio art and art education. You can have class anywhere.
  You can engage education anywhere. You can have learning anywhere. Education is
  a relationship. Teaching and learning is a relationship that''s negotiated between
  multiple parties. And there''s as much learning going on from whoever thinks they
  might be the teacher as there is from folks who might initially think they''re the
  learner. Everyone in that relationship is learning and teaching simultaneously.</p><p>[BIRDS
