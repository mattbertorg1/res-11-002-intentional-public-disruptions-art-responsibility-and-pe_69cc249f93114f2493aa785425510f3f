transcript: "<p>STEPHEN CARPENTER: I thought these three questions could be part of\
  \ our conversation later. I want us to get up and actually create a public work.\
  \ But I've been thinking about how might contemporary art and social practice enable\
  \ conversations about difficult subjects? And that's part of what we're interested\
  \ in.</p><p>Couldn't that be the focus of a curriculum? A multi-week, a multi-session\
  \ unit of instruction with learners of a range of ages and in the range of spaces.\
  \ Or why prepare teachers as agents of positive social change? I mean, some people\
  \ say, oh, we have to prepare them for that, but why? What would come out of that?\
  \ Or why not, right? What does it mean? Maybe the question should be what does it\
  \ mean for teachers to be prepared as agents for social change?</p><p>Some of you\
  \ are studying in departments or programs, where social change, social activism,\
  \ positive social responsibility is central to the mission. Why do that? Is that\
  \ such a good thing? Or how can creative responses to social injustice interrupt\
  \ conditions of inequality? We might not be able to change them. Might not be able\
  \ to stop them. But maybe it interrupts it just long enough to reposition or find\
  \ other ways, other tactics, other approaches to engage.</p><p>I think this is a\
  \ good time to stop. And let's get up, and let's make some public trouble. I brought\
  \ with me some children's books. And I also brought some children's toys. How many\
  \ of you brought cellphones? How many of those cellphones take pictures? Oh, yeah.\
  \ Now we can work as individuals. We can work in pairs or trios, if we want. All\
  \ right?</p><p>I have some children's books here. I'll share them-- show these to\
  \ you. Not all of them deal with uncomfortable stories. Some of them do. There's\
  \ a whole range of things, like Flat Stanley. I don't know if you know of the Flat\
  \ Stanley. To me, there's a Henry Box Brown deal here, where you can mail individuals\
  \ to different places. Here, he's pretty happy about going to visit his family.\
  \ But Henry couldn't do that.</p><p>Or The Big Orange Splot, this is about one house\
  \ being different. And then I won't ruin the story for you at the end, but it's\
  \ about finding your own way. Little Blue and Little Yellow, I don't know if you\
  \ know this story. But when you mix blue and yellow, you get green. And what does\
  \ it mean to be blue or yellow? And how does mixing happen?</p><p>Tar Beach, about\
  \ a little girl who-- she doesn't have something or can't go somewhere. She just\
  \ imagines that she can fly there, and she can capture that experience. Bell Hooks--\
  \ I don't know if you know her children's book, Skin Again.</p><p>There's a wonderful\
  \ book about learning disabilities, reading, in particular. And it's called The\
  \ Art of Miss Chew, where the art teacher, her art teacher, essentially figured\
  \ out she was seeing the world differently. Her reading-- and she was reading the\
  \ spaces between the words, not the words themselves. Just like an artist might\
  \ try to render the negative space, rather than the positive space.</p><p>Or a Maya\
  \ Angelou poem and a Jean-Michel Basquiat poem put together-- or Jean-Michel Basquiat\
  \ images and a Maya Angelou poem, Life Doesn't Frighten Me Anymore. These are children's\
  \ books that I found kids respond to in interesting ways.</p><p>So you might choose\
  \ one of these books and find one of those unexpected public spaces, where you don't\
  \ think education or art, making your art practice, is supposed to happen. You could\
  \ take one of these books, and go and read it there out loud. And have somebody\
  \ else or yourself video tape you or-- not video tape, you can tell how old I am.\
  \ What is it? Make a video, a mobile video of you.</p><p>And you can put one of\
  \ the hashtags. Where are our hashtags, Steve? Here it is. You can hashtag it, and\
  \ pop it up on social media, if you'd like. Or you can take still photo of yourself\
  \ or someone else reading out loud. Or you can take several. Document that experience.\
  \ What would be interesting is to see what kind of social interaction happens. And\
  \ think about the critique. Remember those little tiny townspeople and the tiny\
  \ presidents? The critiques of then the stories of the little people and the stories\
  \ of those spaces. There's a conversation that happens.</p><p>Think about the story\
  \ you might read in that space in relationship to that space. Or I have these little\
  \ toys, just three firefighters, two of whom have razor stub and one has a mustache.\
  \ I wonder how gendered this is. I'm just asking questions right now. Or little\
  \ animals. Or I have little Lego mini figures. These have to be put together. I\
  \ mean, you're welcome to take them, and put them together, and use them in the\
  \ ways that you saw in the photographs, critiquing, having a conversation in a public\
  \ space.</p><p>That story-- where's my-- oh, there it is, Henry's Freedom Box. I\
  \ think I'm going to take one of these pallets. I can't take both of them. I'm going\
  \ to take one of these, and I'm going outside. I'm going to read this book outside.\
  \ I'm going to perform that story outside.</p><p>Henry was lonely. One day, he met\
  \ Nancy, who was shopping for her mistress. They walked, and talked, and agreed\
  \ to meet again. Henry felt like singing. But slaves didn't dare sing in the streets.\
  \ Instead, he hummed all the way home. Henry knew they were very lucky. They lived\
  \ together, even though they had different masters.</p><p>STUDENT 1: &quot;Life\
  \ doesn't frighten me at all, not at all. Life doesn't frighten me at all.&quot;\
  \ Thanks a lot.</p><p>GIRL: Well, what's this for?</p><p>STUDENT 1: Oh, it's a class\
  \ assignment I'm having.</p><p>GIRL: Oh, OK. I noticed there are some other people\
  \ as well.</p><p>STUDENT 1: There are a couple other people doing the same thing.</p><p>GIRL:\
  \ [LAUGHS]</p><p>STUDENT 2: &quot;The house was looking like it was green.&quot;</p><p>STEPHEN\
  \ CARPENTER: Does anyone want to talk about-- you want to talk about your own specific\
  \ experience, either reading a book out loud in public or reading a public space\
  \ in conversation with your figure?</p><p>STUDENT 2: Mainly, people ignored me.\
  \ Some people, like you said, made sort of a wide-- somebody came, realized they\
  \ were sort of in the scope of the photograph. And oh, I'm so sorry. Oh. And you\
  \ were taking a photograph, and you said, no, no, it's OK. You can go in. No, no,\
  \ no, I'm good. So that was interesting. I used to love to read children's books\
  \ to my kids. So I mean, it was just so much fun to be out there and showing everybody.\
  \ And some people looked at me, like oh, OK.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>And some people\
  \ smiled. And I saw people sort of taking pictures as they walked by.</p><p>STEPHEN\
  \ CARPENTER: They looked stealth at the time, right?</p><p>STUDENT 2: [LAUGHS] Exactly.\
  \ And then I was watching you, and I saw somebody doing posing off to the side in\
  \ front of you, like wanting to have a picture. They figured this was some thing.\
  \ And they wanted to be in it, but not really in it. So they were off on the side,\
  \ posing while you--</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>STUDENT 3: That fascinates me, though.\
  \ If you don't even know what it is, why are you so desperate to get a picture?</p><p>STEPHEN\
  \ CARPENTER: Nicholas Mirzoeff, visual culture scholar, uses the word &quot;sublime&quot;\
  \ to talk about those visual moments, or those moments that are so repulsive, you\
  \ can't look away. And so seductive, you can't bear to look at it. I mean, it's\
  \ that tension. But he calls that the sublime. So maybe there is something sublime\
  \ about that that they wanted to be part, but not. They knew something was going\
  \ on, but they weren't supposed to be part of it.</p><p>STUDENT 4: I don't know\
  \ if we were doing it right. But I just had a little Lego guy, and--</p><p>STEPHEN\
  \ CARPENTER: Can we see the little Lego guy?</p><p>STUDENT 4: Yes.</p><p>STEPHEN\
  \ CARPENTER: Can you describe--</p><p>STUDENT 4: And we were just playing-- he is\
  \ a ninja with a hatchet.</p><p>STEPHEN CARPENTER: Of course.</p><p>STUDENT 4: And\
  \ so we playing around with whether he had the hatchet or not had the hatchet and\
  \ giving him-- he had different pictures from magazines or the newspaper. And he\
  \ was in different contexts. And I put him on the water bubbler and was playing\
  \ with him on the water bubbler. But it was interesting, and I did think that my\
  \ kids would have a lot of fun. My students would have a lot of fun with it.</p><p>STEPHEN\
  \ CARPENTER: So, the hatchet-- tell me about why with and without the hatchet? Is\
  \ this the accessorizing, or why was--</p><p>STUDENT 4: We had him in front of the\
  \ headlines. And according to the headline, if he had the hatchet, the headline\
  \ meant one thing. But if he didn't, then it meant a different thing. So that context\
  \ changed, once that weapon was introduced.</p><p>STEPHEN CARPENTER: OK, can you\
  \ give us an example of one of those headlines?</p><p>STUDENT 4: Someone won an\
  \ reward. And we put him in front of that.</p><p>STEPHEN CARPENTER: With the hatchet?</p><p>STUDENT\
  \ 4: With the hatchet, which made it a little bit more ominous. And then without\
  \ the hatchet, he was like, yay, I got this award.</p><p>STEPHEN CARPENTER: [LAUGHS]\
  \ So you see in that example, you're playing with the various symbolic meanings\
  \ that are referenced with not just the ninja, but with that hatchet and the text.\
  \ So there's the layered readings. And even that subtle seemingly innocuous change\
  \ of hatchet or not hatchet shifts readings-- shifts meaning there. It's very powerful.</p><p>I\
  \ hope some of what we've talked about gives you beginning points or places of departure\
  \ for your own work as educators or artists. Continue this work. See what else you\
  \ can trouble, what other kinds of questions you can ask, what other stories might\
  \ be told. Maybe take the little figures, and go make some more imagery. Maybe find\
  \ a fire hose, or attempt other performances. Maybe this is an assignment that would\
  \ work with your students, and give it a shot. And if it does or if it doesn't,\
  \ maybe share it. Social media, drop me a line. We'd love to hear what you're up\
  \ to as a ripple from what we're doing here.</p><p>I said yesterday, and last week,\
  \ as an artist, as an educator, as a researcher, I have found that I'm more interested\
  \ in questioning the answers than I am in answering the questions. And for me, the\
  \ answers are those social constructs, those practices, those systems that people\
  \ have put in place. Sometimes remaining unquestioned or under analyzed. And maybe\
  \ art making through social engagement is one way to provoke reflection, hoping\
  \ to discover something in the process about those constructs.</p><p>I'll leave\
  \ you with this. The National Art Education Association is a professional organization\
  \ in North America. It's open internationally. Primarily made of K-12 art teachers,\
  \ but there are other art educators in the group, higher education professionals,\
  \ museum educators. There are two journals they publish. Studies in Art Education,\
  \ which is essentially the Journal of Issues and Research in art education. And\
  \ then Art Education, which is essentially primarily for K-12 and museum educators.</p><p>And\
  \ each issue, they typically have six articles in here and then an instruction resource.\
  \ But this particular special issue that came out in July of 2017 is a special issue.\
  \ And the call for the theme was creative activity as a human right. And the editor\
  \ said, instead of getting six, I want to see how many I can get. So he cut down\
  \ the length of the submissions. These are shorter pieces, but they're really potent\
  \ little pieces.</p><p>There are so many in here. One of the articles in here is\
  \ called &quot;Socially Engaged Art Education-- Practices, Processes, and Possibilities.&quot;\
  \ And it's about ceramic water filters, public performance, socially engaged art.\
  \ And I co-authored this with two colleagues, Ross Schlemmer, who is a professor\
  \ of art education in southern Connecticut, and Erika Hitchcock, who is a high school\
  \ art teacher in Virginia Beach. And so the three of us put our voices together\
  \ to talk about our experiences here.</p><p>The other piece that I wanted to share\
  \ with you is one that was written by three art educators at Maryland Institute\
  \ College of Art in Baltimore. I just want to read the opening paragraph to you\
  \ and then another excerpt, and then we can have a final set of comments. Their\
  \ article is called &quot;Baltimore Uprising-- Empowering Pedagogy for Change.&quot;\
  \ And it was written by Vanessa L\xF3pez, Adriane Pereira, and Shyla Rao.</p><p>&quot;The\
  \ Baltimore uprising was in response to the death of Freddie Gray, who was fatally\
  \ injured in April 2015 while in police custody in Baltimore City. The first evening\
  \ of the uprising, we were home, glued to the television, communicating with each\
  \ other and our pre-service teachers, worried about violent protests that were erupting\
  \ in parts of the city.&quot;</p><p>That's one of those moments within your own\
  \ community that changes the community. Certainly now, Freddie Gray's name is well-known.\
  \ And so these three art education professors, who were working with pre-service\
  \ teachers, were faced with this real life situation. And what is our responsibility,\
  \ as art educators, as artists, as teachers, as citizens within this community,\
  \ to prepare our teachers to face these issues, these situations? And how do we\
  \ do so responsibly? Not only as community members and related to them, to these\
  \ teachers as our students, but knowing that these folks are going to become teachers\
  \ who might face similar situations.</p><p>And they constructed a pedagogy. They\
  \ called it a pedagogy for change framework. I just want to read briefly what they\
  \ wrote and then open it up. Because I think this piece goes to the heart of what\
  \ this theme for this week has been, dealing with difficult situations and challenging\
  \ social constructs, primarily in this case, police brutality. There's elements\
  \ of white supremacy and racism that flow throughout as well.</p><p>They said, &quot;If\
  \ we, alongside our pre-service teachers engage with self.&quot; That's the first\
  \ piece. So there's four components here, self. &quot;To understand the intersections\
  \ of identities from our lived experiences, examined through the lens of the historical\
  \ context of established social injustices in schools and communities.&quot; Context\
  \ being the second. &quot;Then we have an informed understanding of these complexities\
  \ that,&quot; three, &quot;students contribute to the cultural assets of every classroom,\
  \ with the goal of developing a critical for pedagogy for effecting change were\
  \ deemed necessary.&quot;</p><p>So the culmination of self-- not only teachers,\
  \ but also the selves of the students-- in understanding the context-- social, cultural,\
  \ political, locational-- and bringing the students in there as cultural assets\
  \ within the conversation. Perhaps the pedagogy emerges from that formula. I think\
  \ it's a brilliant piece. And they walk through each of those components for you.&nbsp;</p>"
