title: 'Making Something from Nothing: Community, Water, Pedagogy, and Learning'
transcript: '<p>STEPHEN CARPENTER: So we have heard from the introductions and the
  backgrounds of the people sitting around the table, their numerous interests and
  numerous starting points or ways to connect to issues of water, of community, of
  access. And so the range of disciplinary interests I find quite fascinating.</p><p>And
  in terms of the work that I''ve been doing with curriculum, it really speaks to
  this notion of interdisciplinarity, and some folks use the term transdisciplinarity.
  But in some ways, when we''re interested in key issues, social issues, those disciplines
  go away. It''s about people. It''s about something beyond science or beyond art
  or beyond whatever that discipline might be.</p><p>So our multiple areas of expertise
  really come into play quite nicely here. This year, not only do I have the pleasure
  and the good fortune to be able to visit three times here at MIT as a visiting artist.
  But I''m also a visiting artist and visiting learner at a local elementary school
  back home.</p><p>And essentially, people were asking me, what are you doing at MIT?
  And what are you doing at the elementary school? And I said, I''m doing the same
  thing. Yeah. And the key is I''m going-- I want to know at the elementary school,
  specifically, what they can teach me about what I think I know about what I''m doing.
  And that''s what we''re doing here too. I''m eager to learn about what you can teach
  me about what I think I''m doing, but also what we can teach each other, what we
  can learn from each other.</p><p>Quite often, in some educational spaces, administrators,
  teachers, other folks in various levels of making decisions forget, explicitly or
  otherwise, that learners bring knowledge with them to every single learning context.
  So there''s as much learning going on in one direction as there are in multiple
  directions. So we all have valuable information to share. So I''m eager to have
  that conversation.</p><p>So it''s about the filters, right? It''s about how these
  ceramic water filters inspire multiple curriculum possibilities, not just a curriculum
  or instructional possibilities for how do you make the filter, and how do you use
  them? But there are other ripples, pardon the pun. There are other ways that the
  filters might inspire learning.</p><p>For example, the filters are designed to sit
  inside a plastic water receptacle like the one you see here and the one you saw
  in the video. But what if you asked artists to create a ceramic receptacle in their
  own style if you gave them the specifications, and they created the vessel in their
  own style?</p><p>And then you could actually have an exhibition of these receptacles.
  And that exhibition could tour to different locations. And in doing so, you could
  promote the exhibition. But you could also then talk about the global water crisis.
  You could talk about lack of adequate access to water. You could talk about the
  ways that artists and other folks are engaging in work to respond to these issues.</p><p>And
  so these exhibitions went on for a number of years. My colleagues and I were talking
  about reviving this practice. The idea is if someone purchases one of the receptacles,
  that money essentially is a donation back to a water project.</p><p>This is a vessel
  that I created as part of that work. And it''s inspired by the sanitation workers''
  strike in 1968, I Am a Man. And it relates in many ways to found object art, assemblage
  work from some of the modernist artists. That''s a top of a trophy I found at a
  secondhand store with a guy with a little fedora. It was perfect, right? And I made
  these little signs. But the idea being, how can the work of art itself function
  as a way to speak out and speak back to social issues?</p><p>Inspired by-- this
  one was inspired by the water filters and water filter receptacles. So those links
  become entangled. But they also allow for other trajectories of thinking to happen.
  Well, we can talk about protests. We can talk about, well, what is a basic human
  need? What is a human right? What is privilege? What do you need and what do you
  want? Those are two different things.</p><p>And I think those kinds of conversations
  with students are quite powerful. Who has access? Who sets up the limitations? What
  is necessary? Who takes action? These kinds of questions, I think, are central to
  not only a curricula within art within education, but also curricula within the
  various disciplines that are represented around this table.</p><p>AUDIENCE: I''m
  leaving on the 13th to go to Puerto Rico to a central mountain town, Cidra to bring
  solar lamps, water filters, and solar panels, and solar panel kits to a certain
  sector of a barrio in Cidra. So the idea of a filter that fits in a luggage, because
  I''m limited to what I can personally carry-- three 50-pound bags. And I''m paying
  $75 for the third one, two, three, whatever, to do that, because the bothersome
  part for me, this is not my background. I don''t know.</p><p>So we have rechargeable
  batteries at home that we''ve been very true to. We only use our rechargeable batteries.
  That''s as far as that goes with us. And then the filter water inside it. But water
  is basically good. But seeing all these shipments of bottled water and the requests
  for batteries in an island and just the waste that that will create and that no
  one thinks about. And how can at least in one corner of the world-- or in this case,
  that island, can we try to do something?</p><p>Because I talk to my family. And
  they go to a river, and that''s where they bathe. And that''s where they get water
  to clean. And clean and bathe. That''s it, because they won''t drink it, because
  they don''t know if something died further up the mountain. And they don''t have
  access to that. And then there''s sun everywhere, right? So just that immediate
  thing, and it''s called Sector Bloquera, because at the bottom of the hill, there''s
  a huge hardware type of like-- [SPEAKING SPANISH] just like a lumber yard type of
  thing.</p><p>I was going to say sawdust. I''m like, oh, I can easily get--</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>--I
  can get tons of sawdust from the [SPEAKING SPANISH]. But yeah, the access and how,
  in a limited time frame can one-- as I look at that little one right there just
  to do that, because-- right. And that weighs nothing.</p><p>STEPHEN CARPENTER: It
  weighs nothing.</p><p>AUDIENCE: Yeah. So I guess that''s my of this. And then I
  see [INAUDIBLE], like [INAUDIBLE] Hartford. I''m from Hartford, so he has Hartford
  roots. And Dred Scott, it''s a really exciting presentation. And he contextualizes
  it really incredibly. But this really drew me because of the immediacy of what''s
  happening out there.</p><p>STEPHEN CARPENTER: Absolutely, yeah. Well, what we''re
  seeing in Puerto Rico right now is just-- for me, it''s beyond words, beyond adjectives.
  I can''t-- it''s indescribable. I spoke with a colleague, and friend of mine a few
  days ago. His family is in Puerto Rico. And he says it''s-- he talked about-- before
  we heard the reports in the news about the gas issues and the water issues, he told
  me about both of those.</p><p>I also appreciate your comment about sending water
  bottles and batteries. And that just creates more waste. It''s helpful. But unless
  you think about what happens beyond the life of that material, that''s being irresponsible
  at some level, right? So the rechargeable, the recyclable, the renewable is important.</p><p>Yeah,
  these little filters are made from the same mixture as the large filters. They''re
  just on a smaller scale. You see in the back on that table. We made some mini filters
  yesterday. We still have some clay and sawdust. We can make some more today if you
  want.</p><p>They would need to be tested to make sure that they have the proper
  flow rate. But the other thing is we have to make sure that the water that is there,
  that these filters would filter out the bad stuff in the water that''s there, OK?
  So I''m happy to make some small filters, if you''d like to take some with you.
  And you''d have to see. But you also need to take some test kits. And I have some
  test kits. If I don''t have them here, I can get them. We can get them to you.</p><p>But
  the idea is that you need to test the water. It would be equally irresponsible to
  say, oh, here''s something to take with you and it doesn''t work. So we have to
  figure out what''s in the water. And that''s the basis for setting up the filter
  facilities. But the idea of being able to take some of these in your backpack and
  on your carry-on and being able to distribute it and have immediate response, that''s
  a big deal. And so what you''re up to and the work that you''re going to be doing
  is very important.</p><p>But these things are fragile too. So the packing that it
  would take would require taking up some space as well. So there''s always give and
  take, push and pull. I was talking to someone yesterday about a very similar part
  of the conversation. And one of things we started to do when I was at Texas A&amp;M,
  before I moved to Penn State, was revolving around this very thing. And we thought,
  you know what. May I borrow your bottle for just a second?</p><p>This opening is
  about the same size as larger bottles. I don''t have one here, so like a liter bottle.
  What if we turned it over, and you cut it right here? Or you cut it just enough
  that you could have a little flap, all right? And then what if we took the same
  material, and instead of what some folks are doing with making disks-- they look
  like hockey pucks that you can put inside PVC piping-- what if we made little corks?
  They look like little wine corks, but it''s made out of this material. That could
  fit into this bottle.</p><p>So you lift the hinge. You put the cork down there.
  And then we have our own little portable receptacle. So it would take this bottle
  that then gets discarded that creates waste. Maybe it becomes a repurposed individual?</p><p>Yeah,
  you''re just creating cork. How many wine corks could you take in your backpack?
  Hundreds, right? So it''s that notion of scale and responsibility and access and
  immediacy. Maybe after a couple of weeks or maybe in this case, unfortunately, a
  couple of months, there would not be that need. And you''d have ways to deal with
  the recycling. But anyway, what you''re talking about is a very important issue
  and set of concerns.</p><p>I first became familiar with the term &quot;creative
  disruption&quot; from David Darts, who is an art educator, and his doctoral dissertation
  and work looking at the practice of culture jamming, which grows out of an entire
  practice of responding to capitalism and advertising. So David looked at this idea
  of visual culture jamming, where you add-- instead of looking at culture-specific
  broadly-- visual culture, more specifically, and the way one might look at the visual
  components of a culture differently through some sort of what he called creative
  disruption. Creative meaning, his sense, coming from an artistic or cultural production
  perspective, but yeah, you can be disruptive. One might argue, you know, any kind
  of disruption is creative. But certainly, the creative in this sense comes from
  a more generic notion of artistic or cultural production.</p><p>AUDIENCE: How many
  decades ago, approximately, for that?</p><p>STEPHEN CARPENTER: About one. [LAUGHS]
  Well, no, yes, the term is about 15, 20 years old, in the sense that I understand
  it to be.</p><p>AUDIENCE: It''s been a very popular term in business management.
  Harvard Business School, they''ve been teaching courses in creative destruction
  as a strategy for entrepreneurship. So if you want to take on the big companies,
  you need to do something that disrupts the whole logic of how whatever that service
  or product is is organized and presented.</p><p>STEPHEN CARPENTER: Part of the work
  that I do at my current university and previous universities in art education is
  to prepare teachers of art, but even K-12 teachers. And so with that preparation,
  there are methods courses or curriculum development courses that essentially are
  structured to respond in many ways to very specific skills or content.</p><p>And
  that''s all fine and good, except, what I find more interesting are the questions
  that emerge that can be center points for curriculum. So instead of thinking of
  curriculum development and management, it''s the idea of theorizing curriculum.
  So spinning it around in terms of the questioning, most teacher preparation programs
  that I''m familiar with, because there are these standards and points for accreditation,
  students must meet specific responses. And they''re pretty rigid, those curricula.</p><p>But
  I think that there are ways to play in and around. I''ve worked this way for a while.
  Around, by still responding to those expectations for certification, but at the
  same time, open it up so that teachers become knowledgeable and prepared and have
  experience to have an ongoing engagement with learning and developing interesting
  and exciting curricula that responds to social practices. For</p><p>Example, the
  idea of focusing on a theme or a concept or a question, rather than on a specific
  outcome or skill. Just making that shift is a big challenge for a lot of teacher
  preparation programs, because what you''re doing is you''re essentially saying,
  the predetermined content that we have and the predetermined skills that we have
  is not all there is to our discipline, that there could be more to it.</p><p>And
  it also suggests that it''s not really the idea of learning that''s important in
  education. It''s about teaching content. So I like to turn also the shift from teaching
  to learning, to making the project about learning. And so this is how I''m going
  about it myself, Larry, working with undergrads and grad students to put questions
  at the center of their curriculum. So it becomes an inquiry-based approach. Or it
  becomes a thematic approach.</p><p>And often, it''s inspired by social issues. I
  can show you an example or two, if you''d like, and specifically to water. So one
  of the things that I''ve enjoyed doing is using-- we''ve had a back and forth, Larry,
  about access to education in broad spaces. Online is one way that that happens.</p><p>So
  MindMeister is a free application. And so my early work in curriculum theorizing
  and development looked at spatial hypertext. So what if you took a concept like--
  and more than a concept. I mean, water is a broad idea, a big-- so what if we put
  water at the center here?</p><p>And what I did was, I said, look, at a group of
  students, we said, if we put water at the center, what are the ideas and questions
  and concepts that emerge from just us thinking about water? So there might be technology
  concerns and issues related to pollution. There are contemporary artists who are
  looking at and thinking about water.</p><p>There''s information then at the next
  level that relates to our understandings of water. And so what you''re seeing here
  is an interconnected web of information inspired by the simple notion of water.
  What if you as a teacher-- you can be a teacher, you can be an artist, you can be
  whatever-- what does water make you think of? What questions emerge? What do you
  know about water? What are you curious about about water?</p><p>If you start curriculum
  in that place-- what do you know? What don''t you know? What would be interesting
  to know? And you go off in these various dimensions. And you start to learn along
  the way. And you''re not doing it by yourself. You''re learning with a group of
  people. So everyone in class has access to this web. Everyone in class, over the
  series of days that we''re working on this, can see how it continues to be populated.
  And we all have access to everybody else''s information.</p><p>This is a curriculum
  right here of water that could be navigated, that could be-- and again, I''m not
  showing you all of the details. But you could select certain components of it, highlight
  those components. There might be some key questions. You might like some of the
  things that one person looked at.</p><p>All right, so here are some issues about
  pollution, sanitation in civilizations. This piece also allows us to put embedded
  video and other content. So the idea would be, if the preparation of teachers or
  the work that teachers do as they prepare to be certified and licensed moves away,
  in my view, from only focusing on discipline content, only on discipline skills,
  but privileges the questioning and the nurturing of inquiry and learning, I think
  what we have is we have a different sensibility. You have teachers who aren''t limited
  by their own disciplines and are seeking ways to make those connections. And in
  doing that, a curriculum that comes from this mode of development can then respond
  to any state or local standards of learning, any national curriculum concerns.</p><p>The
  example I want to show you-- you ever been to an elementary art exhibit, and you
  see all of the images look very similar? You see all the paintings and the drawings,
  whatever. Rarely, do we see art criticism. Rarely, do you see young children''s
  art historical papers on display. It happens every once in a while.</p><p>This is
  a water filter display at the Chesterfield County Exhibition. So this is just one
  teacher. Sean Collins did this. And so he used the water filters as part of his
  curriculum but also as part of the art exhibition. He got comments from teachers,
  like, wow, what? How does this-- art? This is part of your art curricula? Well,
  yeah, why not? This is what we''re doing.</p><p>And he linked it to Greek vases.
  And he linked it to expressionist painting. He linked it to all sorts of other components.
  But by making the art curriculum or the space in which an artist might think inclusive
  of appropriate technology and social issues and social responsibility, that''s a
  disruption right there. So can elementary kids do it? Absolutely, they can.</p><p>This
  is a page from the Reservoir Studio, including names of the art teachers who have
  agreed to work with me or found interest or that have invited me to do water filter
  performances but also work on curricula with them. And this list keeps growing.
  I haven''t updated it yet. But I have several others who have been interested.</p><p>Here''s
  a person who came to a curriculum conference, Denise Gordon. She was a science educator
  in Texas. She came to this curriculum and pedagogy conference. And instead of presenting
  a paper on the water filters, my colleague, my mentor Richard Wukich and I, we set
  up a water filter production facility. And we made filters as our conference presentation.
  And so people coming in expecting to see a paper presented, they helped me sift
  sawdust. And [CHUCKLES] we made the filters.</p><p>The reason I''m telling you that
  is because Denise Gordon showed up to that presentation. And she said, I am a science
  teacher, but I think in these interdisciplinary ways. And I like these experiential,
  hands-on approaches. And so I sent her four mini-filters at her request, two that
  had silver embedded in them and two that did not.</p><p>And her advanced science
  students, middle school students, did tests on those water filters. They tested
  the water from two local sources. They did research on the production of the filters.
  And they set up-- they found other commercial filters, and they ran the results.
  And they found that these little filters worked as well or better than those commercial
  filters on two different sources of water. One was, I think, the local river. And
  the other was some other sewage space.</p><p>But my point is that she empowered
  her students to take control and to lead the inquiry. And this is middle school.
  So can middle school students think in these ways and consider their place in the
  world and their responsibility? Absolutely. And again, these are just two of many
  possible ways that this might happen. But just responding specifically to that question.</p><p>AUDIENCE:
  How do we place for the disruptive way of doing things and incremental way of doing
  that thing? Probably what is existing, taking it ahead and improving on it may be
  quite incremented and disruptive where you put a full stop and start with something
  new.</p><p>In fact, ceramic filter itself, I don''t know whether to call it disruptive,
  because a filter existed. And it was modified in some ways. So I''m really confused
  about these definitions about disruptive, incremental. What is it? And how do you
  go back, especially in terms of disasters, where I think the need is to go back
  to basics?</p><p>STEPHEN CARPENTER: For me, disruption is incremental. It''s a process.
  It''s a verb in my thinking. Certainly one can disrupt with a specific action. And
  it seems like it''s only happening in that moment. But we can think more broadly
  that once that moment happens, there are continuing echoes from that.</p><p>So I
  think it''s also site-specific too, the degree of incremental change or disruption
  that happens. But I don''t-- I''m not thinking about disruption, necessarily, as
  one specific moment. I think of it in a longer term, in a moving, time-based way.
  So that''s one part of your question.</p><p>I think the second part had to do with
  the filters and seeing them as disruptive. And certainly, for folks who didn''t
  have adequate access to clean water and now they might have access, the filters
  have disrupted that previous narrative of inaccessibility, and have disrupted a
  longstanding-- a generational experience with being sick and having disease. So
  it''s disrupting that health issue and that human issue. And so there''s that.</p><p>And
  then going back to basic, absolutely. I mean, you do what you need to do. And certainly,
  the water''s coming down. Let''s get some plastic and collect the water. I mean,
  that seems like the most appropriate technology that we''ve talked about today.</p><p>I
  think your examples are right on. And I hope it clarified a little bit how I''m
  thinking about disruption, not as an idea. I didn''t clarify-- disruption for me
  is not a moment. But it''s an ongoing--</p><p>AUDIENCE: It''s a continuum.</p><p>STEPHEN
  CARPENTER: It''s a continuum, absolutely. Yeah. And it''s variable.</p><p>AUDIENCE:
  It was my job too. I mean, it''s a job for us to do that. So even though it''s disruptive
  or not disruptive, my job is to provide clean water to people out there. And that''s
  what I''m doing. [CHUCKLES] So whether it is disruptive or not, it''s that simple.</p><p>STEPHEN
  CARPENTER: Well, yeah, it is. Yeah, yeah, and I think sometimes I like to be a bit
  more dramatic, maybe, than necessary.</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>And to think more broadly
  or differently, folks didn''t have the water. And you allow water to be available.
  You disrupted their lack of access, so--</p><p>AUDIENCE: I think I did my job. [CHUCKLES].</p><p>STEPHEN
  CARPENTER: You did your job.&nbsp;</p>'
