In this video, Carpenter discusses ways to integrate social practice into art education and curricula, using the example of his work on ceramic water filters. He explains how interdisciplinary topics like access to clean water can be integrated into teacher training programs and into curricula for art students. This session will be of interest to art educators, curriculum developers, and those interested in issues of clean water access.
