  Explorations'
transcript: '<p>STEPHEN CARPENTER: We think about conventional activities to expand
  thematic and conceptual exploration. So the traditional ways or maybe more conventional
  ways you might think about art education or learning studio practices-- sculpture,
  working with clay, working with wood, working with paint, or drawing practices--
  those are fine if we want to develop a set of skills. But what about thinking about
  concepts and themes and issues? Well, we might as well get started and do some of
  that now.</p><p>So we''re going to make a little transition. I''m going to set up
  a still life over here. And we''re going to do some drawing. The range of ways in
  which people draw is perfectly acceptable, perfectly acceptable. So if you''re concerned
  that it''s tough for you to draw a conclusion or draw a straight line, don''t be
  concerned by that. It''s the process that we''re interested in, not the visual representation.</p><p>We
  have the three chairs in the center. With your marker, I would like you to draw
  what you see. And you can draw it on this paper the way that it makes sense to you.
  If you want to draw it as large as you can, that''s great. If you want to draw it
  smaller, that''s fine.</p><p>But here''s our still life, these three chairs kind
  of sitting in relationship to each other. We''ll take about 8 to 10 minutes to draw
  this. Oh, but there''s one thing. This is my-- there''s one more thing. You''ll
  draw for 30 seconds at a time. And then after your 30 seconds is over, I have another
  task for you.</p><p>So you''re going to draw the chairs for 30 seconds. And then
  I''ll give you another step to continue your drawing. Got it?</p><p>All right, so
  when you''re ready, set, go. It''s not a race. Just go, time starts now. Try to
  put in as much information as you can.</p><p>All right, stop, stop. Now, what you''re
  going to have to do is slide back in your chair, slide back a little bit. And then
  stand up. And then move one drawing to the left. So now you''re standing in front
  of somebody else''s drawing, to the left. OK, stand in front of the next person--
  the next drawing. All right, now keep drawing. Continue the drawing that this other
  person has started. Go.</p><p>All right, stop, move. Did you learn something about
  drawing from other people''s drawings? Like as you went through and you sat down
  and said, oh, there were some things happening at this new drawing that you''re
  sitting at that you hadn''t thought about that maybe you tried to replicate or you
  tried to avoid.</p><p>LARRY SUSSKIND: My attitude toward what I was doing changed
  rather markedly in different parts of the circle. I started out with trying to take
  the assignment literally. And I assumed that somebody else, that''s their representation
  of that. It''s my job to add-- to complete their representation. But about over
  there, by that time, since I couldn''t figure their representation relative to what
  I was looking at, that I finally decided, well, I could contribute something to
  this, but it isn''t their representation that I''m helping to finish. I''ll just
  focus on adding solid surfaces to ones that don''t have solid surfaces. Because
  clearly, there are some solid surfaces.</p><p>So as I moved along, I was making
  sure I added something. But I wasn''t any longer trying to complete what the message
  was that the previous person, that the original person had left. By the time I got
  over there, I realized people were adding things that were extraneous to the literal
  assignment. And I said, oh, I see. This is just a picture now. This is no longer
  a still life that has to be represented.</p><p>Now there''s people just making it
  into a picture. They''re putting things that are not there in the picture. Oh, OK,
  that''s fun. And so now I realized that the assignment had changed or my conception
  of it had radically altered.</p><p>And then by the time I get back to my own, I
  recognized nothing. And I said, OK, well I can barely find what I started with.
  There''s layers of what other people produced. But my sense of what I was doing
  changed as there were changes imposed by many people before me getting to the picture.</p><p>STEPHEN
  CARPENTER: Man, that''s such a wonderful-- I want to transition to the next drawing
  task. But inherent in what everyone was saying could be applied to other tasks,
  other subjects. Imagine if we didn''t have a set of chairs there. Imagine if there
  was a person there. Instead of drawing with lines, we were drawing with the questions
  we were asking this person who we had never met before. Or maybe we had passed this
  person numerous times like we pass these chairs all the time. These chairs are just
  in the room.</p><p>But now we put them in a space of inquiry. Oh, now I have to
  look. I''ve learned some things about these chairs in this circle that I didn''t
  realize about the chairs before, just by the act of mark-making.</p><p>So what if
  we put a person there, someone we may pass on the street everyday. And we just,
  we stopped-- instead of drawing them-- we could draw them-- what if we asked questions
  of them? What if each mark that we''re making is some form of a question that we''re
  asking? How much more would we learn about that person just by talking to them?</p><p>The
  idea here will be that we''ll still use the chairs. And we''re still building on
  this premise of learning from each other''s drawings. But now instead of us all
  drawing and moving to each other''s drawings, one person will take the drawing implement
  and you will be connected, fixed to that drawing implement. In other words, you''re
  an extension of that drawing implement.</p><p>And your partner has to find a way
  to use you, the drawing implement, to draw the chairs. All you''re doing, drawing
  implement, is holding the marker. The person who is your partner is using-- they
  might have to hold your hand or your elbow or your shoulder or shoulder and wrist.
  That''s why I''m saying need to have the permission of the other person.</p><p>And
  then they''re going to draw what they see, they''re going to draw the chairs using
  you and the marker as the implement. And you''re the implement. You''re kind of
  in it to see how this drawing turns out.</p><p>[INTERPOSING VOICES]</p><p>STEPHEN
  CARPENTER: So some of the words I''m hearing that, to me, work in tandem with this
  notion of themes or concepts-- responsibility, influence, some notion of liberation
  in what you said over there, right, cooperation. So these are themes or concepts
  that might be important to many disciplines or many discourses. But one way we might
  get to it could be doing an activity like this, even though this activity could
  also be taken very literally in terms of formal approaches to revise and enhance
  the way people render, through drawings, who render realistically the objects that
  they''re seeing. But there''s also a conceptual piece here that we don''t want to
  miss.</p>'
